##Part 1: 

In August of 2012, news outlets ranging from the [Washington
Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/poll-shows-atheism-on-the-rise-in-the-us/2012/08/13/90020fd6-e57d-11e1-9739-eef99c5fb285_story.html) to the [Huffington
Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/14/atheism-rise-religiosity-decline-in-america_n_1777031.html)
ran a story about the rise of atheism in America. The source for the story was 
a poll that asked people, "Irrespective of whether you attend a place of 
worship or not, would you say you are a religious person, not a religious 
person or a convinced atheist?"The full press release for the poll, conducted by WIN-Gallup 
International, is found

*<http://www.wingia.com/web/files/richeditor/filemanager/Global_INDEX_of_Religiosity_and_Atheism_PR__6.pdf>*

```{r}
library(mosaic)
```


## The data

Turn your attention to Table 6 (pages 15 and 16), which reports the
sample size and response percentages for all 57 countries. While this is
a useful format to summarize the data, we will base our analysis on the
original data set of individual responses to the survey. Load this data
set into R with the following command.

```{r head-data}
load(url("http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/atheism.RData"))
```


To investigate the link between these two ways of organizing this data, take a 
look at the estimated proportion of atheists in the United States. Towards 
the bottom of Table 6, we see that this is 5%. We can check this 
number using the `atheism` data by running the commands below. Make sure you understand what each of the commands below does after running it.

```{r us-atheism}
us12 <- filter(atheism, nationality == "United States", year == "2012")
tally(~ response, data=us12, format = "proportion")
```


1.  Using a similar series of commands, confirm the calculation of the proportion of atheist 
    responses in our neighboring country of Canada. Does it agree with the percentage of 9\% in Table 6? 

SOLUTION:

**Yes, As per below table, we can see that the proportion of atheists in Canada in 2012 was ~9\% as per hypothesis. Yes, it agrees with the figure in Table 6 Pg 16.**

```{r}
can12 <- filter(atheism, nationality == "Canada", year == "2012")
tally(~ response, data=can12, format = "proportion")
```

## Inference on proportions

The table 6 provides *statistics*, that is, 
calculations made from the sample of 51,927 people. What we'd like, though, is 
insight into the population *parameters*. You answer the question, "What 
proportion of people in your sample reported being atheists?" with a 
statistic; while the question "What proportion of people on earth would report 
being atheists" is answered with an estimate of the parameter.

### A confidence interval

Here is how we'd compute a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of atheists in the United States in 2012.

```{r}
confint(prop.test(~response, data=us12,conf.level=0.95))
```



Although formal confidence intervals don't show up in the 
report, suggestions of inference appear at the bottom of page 7: "In general, 
the error margin for surveys of this kind is $\pm$ 3-5% at 95% confidence".

2.  Based on the R output, what is the margin of error for the estimate of the 
    proportion of the proportion of atheists in US in 2012?
    
SOLUTION:


**From the r output, we can see that the CI = (0.0376198, 0.06574456) and the Margin Error = (Upper Limit-Lower Limit)/2**
**So, The Margin of Error = 0.01406238**

```{r}
ll<-0.0376198
ul<-0.06574456
me = (ul-ll)/2
me
```


3. Calculate a 90\% confidence interval for the proportion of atheists in the United States in 2012. 

SOLUTION:

**The 90% Confidence Interval for the proportion of atheists in the United States in 2012 is between (0.03930392, 0.06302676) and the estimate is 0.0499002. This means that we are 90\% confident that the proportion of atheists in the United States lie between 0.039 and 0.063**


```{r}
confint(prop.test(~response, data=us12,conf.level=0.90))
```

## Part 2.North Carolina births

In 2004, the state of North Carolina released a large data set containing 
information on births recorded in this state. This data set is useful to 
researchers studying **the relation between habits and practices of expectant 
mothers and the birth of their children**. We will work with a random sample of 
observations from this data set.

## Exploratory analysis

Load the `nc` data set into our workspace.

```{r, include=FALSE}
require(mosaic)
```

```{r load-data}
download.file("http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/nc.RData", destfile = "nc.RData")
load("nc.RData")
```

We have observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some 
numerical. The variable descriptions are given below.

variable         | description
---------------- | -----------
`fage`           | father's age in years.
`mage`           | mother's age in years.
`mature`         | maturity status of mother.
`weeks`          | length of pregnancy in weeks.
`premie`         | whether the birth was classified as premature (premie) or full-term.
`visits`         | number of hospital visits during pregnancy.
`marital`        | whether mother is `married` or `not married` at birth.
`gained`         | weight gained by mother during pregnancy in pounds.
`weight`         | weight of the baby at birth in pounds.
`lowbirthweight` | whether baby was classified as low birthweight (`low`) or not (`not low`).
`gender`         | gender of the baby, `female` or `male`.
`habit`          | status of the mother as a `nonsmoker` or a `smoker`.
`whitemom`       | whether mom is `white` or `not white`.


As a first step in the analysis, we should consider summaries of the data. This
can be done using the `summary` command:

```{r summary}
summary(nc)
```


Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps 
us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

Make a histogram of `weeks`, the length of each pregnancy in weeks.

```{r}
histogram(~weeks, data=nc, nint=20)
```


# Part 1. Inference

The human pregnancies typically last 38 weeks. Use $\alpha=0.05$ in each case.

Example 1:

4(a) Test the hypothesis that the mean duration of pregnancies is not equal to 38 weeks. What is your decision?

```{r}
tstar <- qt(.975, df=997)
t.test(~ weeks, data=nc, alternative="two.sided", mu=38)
```

Looking at p-value what is your decision?

SOLUTION: 

**In this question, our null hypothesis H_0 is that the mean duration of pregnancies is equal to 38 weeks, and Alternate Hypothesis H_a is that the mean duration of pregnancies is not equal to 38 weeks.**

**Since the p value is too low ~0 and less than alpha=0.05, we'll reject the null hypothesis test H_0 and claim that the mean duration of pregnancies is not equal to 38 weeks.**

Now look at the Confidence Interval and state your decision base on the CI.
A two-sided hypothesis test at significance level alpha is equivalent to using a confidence interval at (1-alpha)*100% confidence level and looking to see if the hypothesized value is in the confidence interval. If it is, you cannot reject the null hypothesis. If it isn't, you can reject the null.

SOLUTION:

**Since the Confidence Interval is (38.15257,38.51677), we can see that 38 lies outside the confidence interval. So, we'll reject our null hypothesis H_0 and claim that the mean of pregnancies is not equal to 38 weeks.**


Example 2:
4(b) Test the hypothesis that the mean duration of pregnancies is greater than 38 year.What is your decision?

```{r}
m <- mean(~ weeks, data=nc, na.rm=TRUE)
s <- sd(~ weeks, data=nc, na.rm=TRUE)
tstar <- qt(.95, df=997)
t <- (m-38)/(s/sqrt(998))
t.test(~ weeks, data=nc, alternative="greater", mu=38)
```

Looking at p-value what is your decision?

SOLUTION:

**We have Null hypothesis H_0 claim that the mean duration of pregnancies is less than or equal to 38 weeks and alternate hypothesis H_a claim that the mean duration of pregnancies is greater than 38 weeks.**

**Since the value of p is too low (0.0001) and less than alpha (0.05), we'll reject our null hypothesis and claim that the mean of pregnancies is greater than 38 weeks.**

Now look at the Confidence Interval or rather LCB. What is your decision?

SOLUTION:

**Since the confidence interval is (38.18189, Inf) at 95% Confidence, we can see that 38 is not part of the Confidence interval and hence we'll reject out null hypothesis H_0 and claim that the mean of pregnancies is greater than 38 weeks.**

Note:
If you don't know how to calculate one sided bounds, you can use the regular CI (this is just for ilustration, because we covered this material).For a one-sided test at significance level alpha you need a confidence interval at (1 - 2alpha)*100% and again check for the hypothesized value in the confidence interval. If it is in the interval you cannot reject the null. In addition, the confidence interval must either be entirely below or above the hypothesized value (depending on situation) to reject the null. You can also obtain a 1-sided confidence interval (in fact called a 'confidence bound'- this is what we use) - R does this automatically, as seen.  What is your decision?

```{r}
# Method 1
t.test(~weeks,data=nc,
       alternative = "two.sided",
       mu = 38,
       conf.level = 0.90)
```

```{r}
# Method 2
m <- mean(~ weeks, data=nc, na.rm=TRUE)
s <- sd(~ weeks, data=nc, na.rm=TRUE)
tstar1 <- qt(.95, df=997)
SE=s/sqrt(998)

c(m -tstar1*SE, m+tstar*SE)  
m +c(-1,1)*tstar1*SE

```

SOLUTION:

**As per the question, we'll first formulate our hypothesis testing basis and then look at p-value and Confidence Intervals.**

**Our Null Hypothesis H_0 claim is that the mean duration of pregnancies is equal to 38 weeks and Alternate Hypothesis H_a is the mean duration of pregnancies is not equal to 38 weeks. The p-value (0.0003) is less than alpha (0.05) and the Confidence Interval (38.18189,38.48745) doesn't include 38, we'll reject our null hypothesis and claim that the mean duration of pregnancies is not equal to 38 weeks.**


Example 3:

4(c) Test the hypothesis that the mean duration of pregnancies is less than 38 weeks. What is your decision?


```{r}
tstar <- qt(.05, df=997)
t.test(~ weeks, data=nc, alternative="less", mu=38)
```

SOLUION:

**Out null hypothesis H_0 claim is that the mean pregnancies is greater than or equal to 38 weeks and the Alternate Hypothesis H_a claim is that the mean duration of pregnancies is less than 38 weeks. We can see that p-value (0.9998) is greater than alpha (0.05) and the Confidence Interval (-Inf, 38.48745) includes 38. Based on this, we'll accept our null hypothesis and claim that the mean pregnancies is greater than or equal to 38 weeks in length.**

4d. Write down and check that the conditions necessary for inference are satisfied.

SOLUTION:

**The following conditions are required to be satisfied to perform null/hypothesis testing.**

**1. Random Sample - The sample is large enough and is extracted randomly.**

**2. Independence - Since it's not stated and the sample is large and diverse, we'll assume that data points are independent.**

**3. Normality - The population drawn must be normally distributed as the sample size is large and it follows Central Limit Theorem.**

**4. Homogeneity of Variance - Since it's not explicitly given, we'll assume that the data points are evenly distributed around the mean.**

```{r}
nrow(nc)
```

5a. On your own.

Use $\alpha=0.1$ in each case.

(a) Test the hypothesis that the mean age of a mother is less than 27 years old. What is your decision?

```{r}
t.test(~ mage, data=nc, alternative="less", mu=27, conf.level = 0.9)
```

SOLUTION:

**Our Null Hypothesis is that the mean age of mother is greater than or equal to 27y and alternate hypothesis is the mean age is less than 27y.**

**H_0 >= 27 && H_a < 27**

**We can see that the p=value (0.5) is less than alpha (0.1) and the confidence interval (-Inf, 27.25198) does include the hypothesized mean of 27, so we'll reject our null hypothesis and claim that the mean age is less than 27y.**


5(b) Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average age of a mother and interpret it in context.
 

 
```{r}
mage <- t.test(~mage,data=nc,
       alternative = "two.sided",
       mu = 27,
       conf.level = 0.95)
mage$conf.int
```

SOLUTION:

**Our Null Hypothesis is that the mean age of mother is greater than or equal to 27y and alternate hypothesis is the mean age is less than 27y.**

**H_0 >= 27 && H_a < 27**

**The Confidence Interval (26.61442, 27.38558) does include the hypothesized mean of 27y, so we'll reject our null hypothesis claim and say that the mean duration of pregnancies is less than 27y.**

# Part 3. Test Population Proportions and Counts

# Testing one sample proportion to population value - z test for one sample proportion

Example 4:

Birth rate for boys in hospital 
We know that 51.7% of babies born are male in the population.
We observed that 313 boys were born to 550 singleton deliveries in one hospital
Is this different that would be expected by chance?

```{r}
y <- 313; n <- 550; phat <- y/n; phat
nullp <- 0.517
sdp <- sqrt(nullp*(1-nullp)/n); sdp
onesidep <- 1-pnorm(phat, mean=nullp, sd=sdp); onesidep
twosidep <- 2*onesidep; twosidep
```

or we can carry out the exact test (not described by the book):

```{r}
binom.test(y, n, p=nullp)
```


6. What can we conclude for the above example (Example 4)? 

SOLUTION:

**From Example 4, we can see that Null Hypothesis H_0 claim is 51.7\% of babies are born are male in population while the alternate hypothesis H_a is that the male babies born are not 51.7% of total babies. We can see that the p-value (0.01499) is less than alpha(0.05) and the hypothesized percentage 51.7 is not falling in the 95\% confidence interval (0.5265178, 0.6109179), we'll reject null hypothesis and claim that male populations are not 51.7% of total baby population.**

# Testing for a difference in proportions- Two sample z-test for a difference in proportions

Example 5:

Use data from the NYC Maternal Infant HIV Transmission Study
Two qualitative variables (AZT use & Transmission)
A prospective study of HIV transmission to infants among 321 mothers.
Of the 47 women on AZT, 6 transmitted and of the 274 mothers who did not take AZT, 64 transmitted.

```{r}
n1 <- 47; y1 <- 6
n2 <- 274; y2 <- 64
ppooled <- (y1+y2)/(n1+n2); ppooled
sepooled <- sqrt(ppooled*(1-ppooled)/n1 + ppooled*(1-ppooled)/n2); sepooled
z <- (y1/n1 - y2/n2)/sepooled; z
pval <- 2*(1-pnorm(z, lower.tail = FALSE)); pval
```

7. Was AZT effective? Based on what information? Make sure that you read the correct p-value.

SOLUTION:

**Null Hypothesis - AZT was effective. Alternate Hypothesis - AZT was not effective.**

**We can see that the z-score is 1.625 which comes to around 90% confidence interval or alpha (0.1). We can also see that the p_value is 0.104. Since p-value is greater than alpha, we'll accept our null hypothesis test that AZT was effective.**

In the previous example of MTC HIV transmission, we had counts
If instead, we had counts and proportions we could use this code to calculate the standard error of the difference and create a confidence interval.

```{r}
n1 <- 47; p1 <- 0.13
n2 <- 274; p2 <- 0.23
sediff <- sqrt(p1*(1-p1)/n1 + p2*(1-p2)/n2); sediff
(p2 - p1) + c(-1.96, 1.96)*sediff
```

8. Was AZT effective? Does the result match the conclusion in Question 6?

SOLUTION:

**We see that hypothesize proportion of male babies is 0.13 and the Confidence Interval constructed is (-0.00829303 , 0.20829303). Since the hypothesized proportion lies inside the confidence interval, we'll accept our null hypothesis and claim that AZT was effective.**

# Part 4. Test Population Menas

Example 6: 

Acquire the WNBA & NBA datafile

```{r}
bball <- read.csv("http://pmatheson.people.amherst.edu/Basket.csv")
glimpse(bball)
```

Take a peek at the data

```{r}
names (bball)
head (bball)

```

Look more closely at the variables

```{r}

favstats (~HEIGHTIN |GENDER, data=bball)
favstats (~WEIGHTLB |GENDER, data=bball)

histogram (~WEIGHTLB |GENDER, data=bball)
histogram (~HEIGHTIN |GENDER, data=bball)

```


## Comparing one group mean to population - a one sample t-test

Are Women in WNBA taller than US women in general?
To answer this question we need to compare the sample of WNBA heights to NHANES mean height which has population values of: (mu=63.75, sd=3.423)

```{r}
mu=63.75
sd=3.423
womenonlyds <- filter(bball, GENDER=="Female")
xpnorm(c(mu-3*sd, mu-2*sd, mu-sd, mu+sd, mu+2*sd, mu+3*sd), mean=mu, sd=sd)
t.test(womenonlyds$HEIGHTIN, alternative="greater", mu=63.75, data=womenonlyds)

```

9. What do we conclude?  Are women playing professional basketball taller than American women?

SOLUTION:

**Our Null Hypothesis claim is that Professional Basketball player is not taller than American woman and the alternate hypothesis is that the Professional Basketball player is taller than American Women. The hypothesized mean is 63.75 and the Confidence Interval is (70.8938, Inf). Since the hypothesized mean is outside the confidence interval, we'll reject our null hypothesis and claim that Professional basketball players are taller than American women.**

## Comparing two groups to each other - a two Sample independent t-test

If people who play basketball tend to be exceptionally tall would we expect women playing professional basketball to be as tall as the men?

Using the bball data we can ask if women in WNBA different in terms of men in NBA?

```{R}
t.test(HEIGHTIN ~ GENDER, data=bball) # Unpooled
t.test(HEIGHTIN ~ GENDER, var.equal=TRUE, data=bball)   # Pooled
bwplot(GENDER ~ HEIGHTIN, data=bball)
```

(We went over 2 independent t-tests , one assumes equal variance like the test above. If you don't include var.equal=TRUE you will have Welch test )

10. Are there difference in the heights of men and women professional basketball players?

SOLUTION:

**Null Hypothesis - There is no difference in the heights of men and women basketball player. Alternate Hypothesis - There is difference in the height of men and women basketball players. From the above two tests, we can see that the p-value (9.339e-06 and 8.564e-06) are less than alpha (0.05) and both the Confidence Interval (-10.20058, -4.799417) and (-10.204201, -4.795799) doesn't include 0. Based on this, we'll reject our null hypothesis and claim that there is significant difference in the heights of men and women basketball player.**

## Comparing Groups when data is paired - Dependent t-test using difference scores

Example 6:

This is a special case of data. 

We are not comparing the mean of one group vs. another. We have the same group of people over time with matched data.  Paired data can also come from different people (twins, siblings, etc.), the unique aspect is that two numbers belong together.
For this analysis we will be using data from National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS).  A nationally representative sample of eighth-graders were first surveyed in the spring of 1988. A sample of these respondents were then resurveyed through four follow-ups in 1990, 1992, 1994, and 2000. On the questionnaire, students reported on a range of topics including: school, work, and home experiences; educational resources and support; the role in education of their parents and peers; neighborhood characteristics; educational and occupational aspirations; and other student perceptions. Additional topics included self-reports on smoking, alcohol and drug use and extracurricular activities. For the three in-school waves of data collection (when most were eighth-graders, sophomores, or seniors), achievement tests in reading, social studies, mathematics and science were administered in addition to the student questionnaire.

Question: Many middle schoolers say their grades don't matter and they'll work harder in high school. We can answer this question using data from NELS.  For this example we'll operationally define performance as reading achievement.  

Create difference scores between reading achievement scores in 8th and 10th grade for each participant.

```{r}
educ <- read.csv("http://pmatheson.people.amherst.edu/NELS.csv")
educ <- mutate(educ, diff = ACHRDG10 - ACHRDG08); 

favstats (~ACHRDG08, data=educ)
favstats (~ACHRDG10, data=educ)
favstats (~diff, data=educ)
densityplot (~diff, data=educ)
histogram (~diff, data=educ)
```

11. Create a confidence interval for the difference and perform the correct hypothesis test - you are back to one - mean t test , with variable diff. Did reading achievement scores differ over time (between 8th and 10th grade)? If so, why? If not, why not?

SOLUTION:

**Null Hypothesis - There is no difference between the 8th and the 10th grade. Alternate hypothesis - There is significant difference between the 8th and 10th grade. The Confidence itnerval we get is (-0.4649723, 0.5949323). Since the confidence interval doesn't include 0, we'll reject our null hypothesis and claim that there is significant difference between the 8th and the 10th grade**

```{r}

educ <- t.test(~diff, data=educ, alternative="two.sided", mu=0, conf.level=0.95)
educ$conf.int
```
